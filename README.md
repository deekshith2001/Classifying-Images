Project done as part of the course CS135 (Introduction to Machine Learning), Fall 2023, Tufts University.

Abstract of the project:
<br>
To construct a classifier to map a given grayscale image to the type of clothing it depicts using the FashionMNIST-6 dataset. FashionMNIST-6 is a custom subset of the FashionMNIST<sup>1</sup> dataset. Each image is 28x28 pixels, showing the silhouette of an item of clothing. There are six possible classes. The possible classes are dress, pullover, top, trouser, sandal, and sneaker. 

<br>

The project has two parts. Q1 is restricted to a single-layer MLP. Q2 is an open-ended problem. For more details about the project and the dataset, refer to the website: https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/135/2023f/projectB.html
